A Rimworld mod, for indoor plant-growing.

## Mushrooms
- mushroom-planter item
    - no power
    - not speedy like hydro
    - only mushrooms
- glowball
    - plantable in flower-pot
    - pretty

## Potatoes
- not growable in hydroponics anymore
    - this is a one-time puzzle / new-person trap
        - not fun after the first time
        - rice / berries / healroot / etc offer long-term trade-offs
        
## Hay-Grass in Hydroponics
- replaces potatoes
